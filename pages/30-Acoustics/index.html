= Acoustics

When working in any audio discipline it is obviously crucial to understand the underlying principles of sounds; how they are created, how they travel through air and how they are influenced by the acoustic space in which they are produced or recorded. Whether you are listening to a musical instrument in the same room or you record it and play it back in another, how sound behaves will influence your listening experience significantly. In the latter case you actually have two sound sources (the instrument and the loudspeaker) and two acoustic spaces (the recording room and the listening room) that will impact what you hear. This is why for a recording engineer/music producer it is even more important to understand the principles of sound than it is for a musician or the audience.
