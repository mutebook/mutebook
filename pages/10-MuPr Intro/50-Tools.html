= The Tools

Her is a list of equipment that you will most likely have to use at some point during your work in audio production:

- microphones
- microphone stands
- cables
- microphone pre-amplifiers
- mixing consoles (analogue or digital)
- D/A converters
- A/D converters
- audio interfaces
- analogue and digital signal processors
- digital Audio Workstations (DAW)
- direct injection (DI) boxes
- headphones
- studio monitors (loudspeakers)
- amplifiers
- SPL meters
- hardware and software synthesizers
- MIDI controllers
- computers
- scores and pencil
- etc.

This list is just a very rough overview. Each of the items listed could in itself be a whole list of options. For example, there are hundreds of microphones available and each one will yield a different result. The arsenal of signal processors is expanding constantly, especially in the digital domain and the range of DAWs you can choose from is growing, too. With all these tools available to us, it is sometimes easy to forget what music production is all about. In the end all that matters is what you create with the tools and not the tools themselves. Understanding what the equipment does is essential, but experimentation (which is also quite safe if you understand the equipment) and using the tools in creative ways is just as important. When you are overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of your equipment, thinking about what you are trying to create will guide you along the way. If you are just using tools for the sake of using them (while it can be a lot of fun) the risk of getting lost and never reaching the finish line is very high.
