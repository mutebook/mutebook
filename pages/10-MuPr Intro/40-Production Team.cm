= The Production Team

Various people can contribute to a music production. The number of people who work on the production depends very much on the kind of production and the production budget. Generally speaking one could say that the larger the budget, the more specialized people apply their unique skills to create the final result. While for a low-budget classical string quartet recording, only a sound engineer and a producer (sometimes one and the same person) will take care of the recording, the editing, the mixing, and the mastering, a larger production might involve a recording engineer (sometimes an assistant engineer and/or tape operator), a recording producer, a mixing engineer, and a mastering engineer. Sometimes you might also find musicians, composers and conductors in the control room during any stage of the production. With fast internet connections that are available today, the members of the team might be spread all across the world and might have never met in person. An album recorded in Europe might be mixed in America or vice versa.
