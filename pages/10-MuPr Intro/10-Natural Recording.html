= Natural Recording

Most classical music is recorded in acoustic environments where classical music is usually performed, such as concert halls or churches.
# add links to acoustics
The space in which the performance takes place and its acoustic properties play an important role for the audience's experience. As most of the people who listen to classical music at home have experienced classical music performed live in a concert hall, there are certain expectations (concerning spatial impression, stereo image, timbre, etc.) the recording has to meet in order to appeal to them. Therefore, oftentimes when recording classical music, the entire ensemble plays within the same space and the direct sound and the reflections are all captured simultaneously. The final result tries to create the sensation of a live performance. This is sometimes called {/natural recording}. While there are some audiophiles out there who refuse to use anything else than microphones (some of them never more than two), working in classical music does not mean that you should rule out any other tools right away. If an equalizer, compressor, or an alternative way of recording improves the final result, there is no reason not to use it. After all, we have to keep in mind that trying to mimic a live performance is destined to fail so we have to do more in order to create an impressive sounding production. Just keep in mind that the listener might expect a {/naturally} sounding result.
# Classical music production will be discussed in greater detail in another {todo: section\link}.
