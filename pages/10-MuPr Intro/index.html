= Introduction to Music Production

== What is Music Production?

Without becoming too philosophical, let us start with a brief description of what happens in music production and recording so that we know what we have to learn in order to prepare for creative work in the music industry. Recording is a relatively young art (just over 100 years old),
#{todo: add link to history resources}
but technological developments have been introduced constantly and have changed the way music is created, recorded and produced. Despite the rapid developments and constantly evolving genres of music, the basic guiding principle of bringing an artistic idea or message from the creator to the audience remains unchanged.

The diagram above shows the simplified signal flow of the artistic message, from the creator (the composer) to the receiver (the audience). The composition is interpreted by the performer and played in front of a live audience. The audience is present in the same room at the same time as the performer. The musicians' voices or instruments can be considered to be the tools the performers use to deliver the composer's message to the audience. Once the music has been transduced into acoustic form, it travels through the concert hall to the audience.

The diagram below shows the same signal flow for recorded music. You see that the audience is taken out of the concert hall and placed into a different space and that the production process is added as link between the performance and the audience. The production process itself entails various different stages, but the very basic goal remains unchanged {---} delivering the composers intentions to the audience. Thinking of this relatively simple goal when you are stuck with the smallest technical details can be very helpful in guiding you to make productive decisions. Separating the audience from the performer also has other implications. First, the lack of visual information will make us experience the music in a different way than during a concert. In addition, the feeling of going to the concert hall, being a member of the audience, and being physically close to the performers on the stage all contribute to the enjoyment of a live performance. All these elements will be missing when listening to recorded music even if we were able to re-create an exact acoustic footprint of the original performance. Despite the fact that we are destined to fail in a quest of bringing the live concert experience into the living room, we can use the art of recording to create an equally (or even more) exciting experience for the listener, as long as we are aware of the possibilities and limitations.

Many contemporary music productions are even created with the listeners at home (or with headphones on the train) in mind, using the medium very specifically to deliver the artistic message directly to the listener.

So generally speaking, one could say that the music production process is the process of capturing a musical performance or an idea so that an audience can enjoy it at a different time and a different place than the original performance. This is certainly true for traditional music genres in which the music was created with the performance in mind (e.g., classical music). The rise of recording and the development of technology have provided us with creative possibilities that go far beyond capturing a traditional live performance. In some situations the music might have never been performed as heard by the listener coming from the final medium. Techniques (overdubs, editing, etc.) and tools might have been used that create a listening experience that does not have much to do with how the music was performed inside the studio. The following paragraphs will differentiate between {/natural recording} (even though this is a horrible term and there is nothing unnatural about recording in a studio) and {/studio recording}, so let us first discuss these two approaches.
