This section explains some of the very basic principles of math and geometry that are needed in order to understand material covered in other sections, especially those on {:mb_acou} and {:mb_mics}. For example, sine and cosine are important for sound waves, the logarithm is needed when calculating decibel values. Both are invaluable for sound synthesis.
