# Features

# Nice to have

* open external links in a separate, reused, tab (target=cm_book_extern)
* Navigation menu: make folder triangles clickable separately - to open / close folders;
  when a page (incl. folder index page) is clicked, behaviour as is now: the page shown,
  the menu folder opened / closed as needed, on small screens menu slides out.
* in the nav menu, enable items for right-click

# Bugs

* site refresh or browser back/forth buttons should work
