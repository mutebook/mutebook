# Features

* editor's notes (visible only in development mode)
* footnotes (hook)

# Nice to have

* Navigation menu: make folder triangles clickable separately - to open / close folders;
  when a page (incl. folder index page) is clicked, behaviour as is now: the page shown,
  the menu folder opened / closed as needed, on small screens menu slides out.
* in the nav menu, enable items for right-click

# Bugs

* site refresh or browser back/forth buttons should work

# Internal - code-related

* in individual pages, limit `cm_book.toc = ` to prev/next; also limit js
