= Introduction to Music Production

==== What is Music Production?

Without becoming too philosophical, let us start with a brief description of what happens in music production and recording so that we know what we have to learn in order to prepare for creative work in the music industry. Recording is a relatively young art (just over 100 years old),
#{todo: add link to history resources}
but technological developments have been introduced constantly and have changed the way music is created, recorded and produced. Despite the rapid developments and constantly evolving genres of music the basic guiding principle of bringing an artistic idea or message from the creator to the audience remains unchanged.

The diagram above shows the simplified signal flow of the artistic message from the creator (the composer) to the receiver (the audience). The composition is interpreted by the performer and played in front of a live audience. The audience is present in the same room at the same time as the performer. The musicians' voices or instruments can be considered tools the performers use to deliver the composer's message to the audience. Once the music has been transduced into acoustic form it travels through the concert hall to the audience.

The diagram below shows the same signal flow for recorded music. You see that the audience is taken out of the concert hall and placed into a different space and the production process is added as link between the performance and the audience. The production process itself entails various different stages, but the very basic goal remains unchanged - delivering the composers intentions to the audience. Thinking of this relatively simple goal when you are stuck with the smallest technical details can be very helpful in guiding you to make productive decisions. Separating the audience from the performer also has other implications. First, the lack of visual information will make us experience the music in a different way than during a concert. In addition, the feeling of going to the concert hall, being a member of the audience, and being physically close to the performers on the stage all contribute to the enjoyment of a live performance. All these elements will be missing when listening to recorded music even if we were able to re-create an exact acoustic footprint of the original performance. Despite the fact that we are destined to fail in a quest of bringing the live concert experience into the living room, we can use the art of recording to create an evenly (or even more) exciting experience for the listener, as long as we are aware of the possibilities and limitations.

Many contemporary music productions are even created with the listeners at home (or with headphones on the train) in mind, using the medium very specifically to deliver the artistic message directly to the listener.

So generally speaking one could say that the music production process is the process of capturing a musical performance or idea so that an audience can enjoy it at a different time and a different place than the original performance. This is certainly true for traditional music genres in which the music was created with the performance in mind (e.g., classical music). The rise of recording and the development of technology have provided us with creative possibilities that go far beyond capturing a traditional live performance. In some situations the music might have never been performed as heard by the listener coming from the final medium. Techniques (overdubs, editing, etc.) and tools might have been used that create a listening experience that does not have much to do with how the music was performed inside the studio. The following paragraphs will differentiate between {/natural recording} (even though this is a terrible term and there is nothing unnatural about recording in a studio) and {/studio recording}, so let us first discuss these two approaches.
#{todo: section needs to be extended}

==== Natural Recording
Most classical music is recorded in acoustic environments where classical music is usually performed, such as concert halls or churches.
# add links to acoustics
The space in which the performance takes place and its acoustic properties play an important role for the audienceâ€™s experience. As most of the people who listen to classical music at home have experienced classical music performed live in a concert hall there are certain expectations (concerning spatial impression, stereo image, timbre, etc.) the recording has to meet in order to appeal to them. Therefore, oftentimes when recording classical music the entire ensemble plays within the same space and the direct sound and the reflections are all captured simultaneously. The final result tries to create the sensation of a live performance. This is sometimes called {/natural recording}. While there are some audiophiles out there who refuse to use anything else than microphones (some of them never more than two), working in classical music does not mean that you should rule out any other tools right away. If an equalizer, compressor, or an alternative way of recording improves the final result, there is no reason not to use it. After all, we have to keep in mind that trying to mimic a live performance is destined to fail so we have to do more in order to create an impressive sounding production. Just keep in mind that the listener might expect a {/natural} sounding result.

==== Studio Recording

In most of the other music genres, artificial reverb is used during the live performance that is not linked to the concert venue. In fact, the recording might have been created this way and the live performance is trying to recreate what is heard on the record. As such, artificial acoustics are applied to tracks that are recorded dry (without reverb). While in natural recording it is usually expected that the entire ensemble is placed within the same acoustic space, in other genres it is not uncommon to hear many different reverbs with various acoustic properties on different tracks or groups of tracks.

However, the acoustics of recording studios still play an important role and certain studios are famous for their unique sound, even though artificial reverb is added later. After all, you superimpose the artificial reverb onto anything that is captured during the recording session, including any trace of the acoustic space in which the recordings took place. Depending on the artists, the recording venue and the type of production, sometimes the whole band is recorded simultaneously (sometimes each member in a separate room) while often each track is recorded individually. By doubling tracks, recording the same performer multiple times and by combining various sounds and effects, creative possibilities become endless and the production team can create something that would not be possible otherwise.

With the continuously expanding arsenal of artificial reverberation including ultra-realistic convolution reverbs you might ask yourself why classical music is not just recorded dry and combined with artificial reverb during post-production. While this is certainly an option, there is one significant difference between capturing the reverb of a concert hall during a natural recording and applying the same reverb on a studio recording during post production. This difference can be found in what is {/sent} into the reverb. During a natural performance the space is fed with the sound of the instrument completely around the sound source. This is a very complicated situation because the different parts of the spectrum dissipate differently around the instrument. Some frequencies might only travel at a certain angle away from the instrument, while others might travel into all directions. This differs for each instrument which further complicates how the natural space is filled with sound. In comparison, during a studio recording, there is a limited number of microphones capturing the sound of the instruments only at certain angles. The signal is thus only captured at these positions and the reverb is fed with the captured material only. This difference is shown in the diagram below.

Understanding this difference is important but this does not mean that one way or the other is the only way to record. As always in art, it depends on what you are trying to create.

==== Production Steps

Now that we are aware of the difference between natural recording (sometimes also called acoustic recording) and studio recording, let us take a look at the various different steps a music production can go through until the final product is created.

In natural music production you typically go through the following steps:

* Recording
* Editing
* Mixing
* Mastering

{_1. Recording}

During the recording days you will have to
- Set up the equipment
- Sound-check
- Record
- Record Overdubs (this is not a very common step for classical recording, but it does happen)
- Take down and pack the equipment

{_2. Editing}

During editing you combine various sections of different takes in order to assemble the music according to the score.

{_3. Mixing}

In the mixing stage of a natural music production, all recorded tracks are combined into 2-channel stereo, multi-channel surround, or whatever other format is used. Sometimes the recorded signals of all the microphones are just summed for the mix. Other times, the signals might be altered with signal processors
# add link}
and/or artificial reverb is added in order to create the final mixdown.


{_4. Mastering}

The 2-channel or multi-channel mix is forwarded to mastering where additional sonic changes and loudness corrections are made, silence between tracks is added and the final disk image (as long as disks still exist) is created and forwarded for manufacturing.


{_Pre Production}

Before the first note is recorded a lot of planning and preparation is required. This includes score preparation, studio booking, designing the microphone set-up and a patch list, travel arrangements, etc. Do not underestimate the time it takes to prepare for a production. You expect the musicians to have practiced the music, so as producer/engineer you have to be just as well prepared in order to guarantee a smooth production work-flow. When booking the recording space, make sure to allow sufficient time for set-up, line-checks, sound-check and tear down. If you are flying or driving for a long time before you have to record, plan in some time for your ears to rest so that they are fully functional when the sound-check starts. If you are recording on location (e.g., a church or school auditorium) keep in mind that you will need additional time to set-up the control room, something you do not have to do when recording in a studio.


==== The Production Team

Various people can contribute to a music production. The number of people who work on the production depends very much on the kind of production and the production budget. Generally speaking one could say that the larger the budget, the more specialized people apply their unique skills to create the final result. While for a low-budget classical string quartet recording, only a sound engineer and a producer (sometimes one and the same person) will take care of the recording, the editing, the mixing, and the mastering, a larger production might involve a recording engineer (sometimes an assistant engineer and/or tape operator), a recording producer, a mixing engineer, and a mastering engineer. Sometimes you might also find musicians, composers and conductors in the control room during any stage of the production. With fast internet connections that are available today, the members of the team might be spread all across the world and might have never met in person. An album recorded in Europe might be mixed in America or vice versa.

==== What You Need to Know?

When you read through the previous paragraphs, you realize that all this means that you need to be as proficient and knowledgeable as possible in quite a few areas. Because you work in a team and collaborate with musicians, you need to have social skills and know how to work with artists and help them to achieve their best performance right when you need it. You also need to understand the music, so that you can communicate with everyone and contribute to improve the final product. Next, you need to understand some of the science of sound. Room acoustics, acoustics of sound sources, psychoacoustics, electronics, electro-acoustics are all significant when working in audio. Depending on your particular discipline, you might get away with not being an expert in all of them, but the more you know the better. Knowing the possibilities in mastering will help you making important decisions in the mix. Understanding the editing process will significantly influence how you work during the recording sessions. Understanding how the tools work and what you can achieve with them will help you in creating what you want to create and when trouble-shooting. While there are brilliant and successful sound engineers out there who do not care about inner workings of analogue pieces of equipment or algorithms of plug-ins, there are also those who build their own gear or write their own plug-ins for signal processing. In addition to providing you with more tools to do your job, this could potentially be another area of employment or an additional source of income.

We hope that $MB is a good resource for you to start or extend your knowledge of some of the science that works in the background while you are creative in your specific audio discipline. While you can go through all topics in a linear fashion (progressing through the material from the beginning to the end), you can also choose to start with topics that speak to you the most.
